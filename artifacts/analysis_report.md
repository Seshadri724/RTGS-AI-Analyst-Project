### Report from Chunk 1
## Data Analysis Report

**1. Dataset Overview**

*   The dataset "sample\_data.csv (chunk 1)" contains 3996 rows and 11 columns.
*   The columns include information about geographical locations ("circle", "division", "subdivision", "section", "area"), customer category ("catdesc", "catcode"), and service usage ("totservices", "billdservices", "units", "load").
*   The data types are a mix of objects (strings) for location and category descriptions, integers for category codes and substantial services, and floats for billed services, units, and load.

**2. Data Quality Notes**

*   The dataset has a data quality score of 10.0/10, suggesting high data quality.
*   Missing values in the 'area' column were filled with "KOTHAPALLY".
*   Missing values in the 'billdservices' column were filled with 112.0.
*   Duplicate rows were dropped from the dataset.
*   After cleaning, there are no missing values in any of the columns.

**3. Key Insights**

*   The dataset includes categorical variables such as 'circle', 'division', 'subdivision', 'section', 'area', and 'catdesc'. Further analysis could explore the distribution of services and load across these categories.
*   The 'catcode' column represents a numerical encoding of the customer category. Analyzing the relationship between 'catcode', 'totservices', 'billdservices', 'units', and 'load' might reveal usage patterns for different customer types.
*   The dataset contains numerical columns 'totservices', 'billdservices', 'units', and 'load'. Analyzing the distributions of these columns and their relationships could provide insights into service usage patterns.
*   The 'totservices' and 'billdservices' columns represent the substantial services and billed services, respectively. Comparing these two columns might reveal discrepancies or patterns in billing.
*   The 'units' column represents the number of units consumed. Analyzing this column in relation to 'load' could provide insights into the load per unit.

**4. Recommendations**

*   Explore the distribution of 'totservices', 'billdservices', 'units', and 'load' across different geographical locations ('circle', 'division', 'subdivision', 'section', 'area') to identify areas with high or low service usage.
*   Analyze the relationship between 'catcode' and service usage metrics ('totservices', 'billdservices', 'units', 'load') to understand the consumption patterns of different customer categories.
*   Investigate the correlation between 'totservices' and 'billdservices' to identify potential billing discrepancies.
*   Analyze the relationship between 'units' and 'load' to understand the load per unit and identify potential inefficiencies.

**5. Suggested Visualizations**

*   **Bar charts:** To visualize the distribution of categorical variables such as 'circle', 'division', 'subdivision', 'section', 'area', and 'catdesc'.
*   **Histograms:** To visualize the distribution of numerical variables such as 'totservices', 'billdservices', 'units', and 'load'.
*   **Scatter plots:** To visualize the relationship between two numerical variables, such as 'units' and 'load', or 'totservices' and 'billdservices'.
*   **Box plots:** To compare the distribution of a numerical variable across different categories, such as 'load' across different 'catcode' values.
*   **Geographic maps:** To visualize the spatial distribution of service usage metrics.

### Report from Chunk 2
## Data Analysis Report

**1. Dataset Overview**

*   The dataset "sample\_data.csv (chunk 2)" contains 3993 rows and 11 columns.
*   The columns include categorical features such as "circle", "division", "subdivision", "section", "area", and "catdesc", which likely represent geographical and descriptive categories.
*   Numerical features include "catcode", "totservices", "billdservices", "units", and "load", which likely represent service codes, service counts, billing information, unit measurements, and load values.
*   The data types are a mix of objects (strings) and integers/floats, as indicated by the `dtypes` field.

**2. Data Quality Notes**

*   The dataset has a data quality score of 10.0/10, suggesting high data quality.
*   There are no missing values in any of the columns ("circle", "division", "subdivision", "section", "area", "catdesc", "catcode", "totservices", "billdservices", "units", "load").
*   Duplicate rows were removed during the cleaning process.
*   Missing values in the 'area' column were filled with "DACHARAM".
*   Missing values in the 'billdservices' column were filled with 111.0.

**3. Key Insights**

*   The dataset includes information about various geographical locations, as indicated by the "circle", "division", "subdivision", "section", and "area" columns.
*   The "catdesc" column provides descriptions of service categories, while "catcode" provides corresponding numerical codes.
*   The "totservices" column indicates the substantial number of services, while "billdservices" represents the number of billed services.
*   The "units" column likely represents the number of units consumed, and "load" represents the load value.
*   The sample data shows that for "RAJENDRA NAGAR" circle, "KANDUKUR" division, "MAMIDIPALLY" subdivision, "MAHESHWARAM" section, and "MOHABATH NAGAR" area, the "AGRICULTURAL" category (catcode 5) has 94 substantial services with 69 billed services, 0 units, and a load of 349.5.
*   The sample data also shows that for "RAJENDRA NAGAR" circle, "KANDUKUR" division, "MAMIDIPALLY" subdivision, "MAHESHWARAM" section, and "MOHABATHNAGAR" area, the "AGRICULTURAL" category (catcode 5) has 1 substantial service with 1 billed service, 0 units, and a load of 3.75.
*   The sample data also shows that for "RAJENDRA NAGAR" circle, "RAJENDRA NAGAR" division, "GAGANPAHAD" subdivision, "MD PALLY" section, and "JANGEERABAD" area, the "AGRICULTURAL" category (catcode 5) has 1 substantial service with 1 billed service, 0 units, and a load of 3.75.

**4. Recommendations**

*   Further analysis could focus on understanding the distribution of services across different geographical locations and service categories.
*   Investigate the relationship between "totservices" and "billdservices" to identify potential areas for improving billing efficiency.
*   Explore the correlation between "units" and "load" to understand energy consumption patterns.
*   Analyze the "catcode" and "catdesc" columns to gain insights into the types of services being provided.

**5. Suggested Visualizations**

*   **Bar charts:** To compare the number of services ("totservices") across different "circle", "division", "subdivision", "section", and "area" categories.
*   **Histograms:** To visualize the distribution of numerical features such as "billdservices", "units", and "load".
*   **Scatter plots:** To explore the relationship between "units" and "load".
*   **Pie charts:** To show the proportion of different service categories ("catdesc").
*   **Box plots:** To compare the distribution of "load" across different service categories ("catdesc").
