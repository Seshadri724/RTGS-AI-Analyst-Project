## Weather Data Analysis Report

**1. Dataset Overview**

This dataset contains weather information for various districts and mandals. It includes daily records of rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures, minimum and maximum humidity, and minimum and maximum wind speeds. The dataset comprises 11,176 rows and 10 columns. The columns consist of object (categorical) and float64 (numerical) data types. Specifically, 'District', 'Mandal', and 'Date' are object types, while the remaining columns representing weather measurements are float64.

**2. Data Quality Notes**

*   **Missing Values:** The dataset initially contained missing values across all columns. These missing values were imputed using specific values as detailed in the cleaning log.
*   **Duplicates:** Duplicate rows were present in the original dataset and have been removed. A total of 1785 duplicate rows were dropped.
*   **Data Types:** The data types appear appropriate for each column.
*   **Date Format:** The 'Date' column is currently stored as an object. For time-series analysis, it should be converted to datetime format.

**3. Key Insights**

*   **Districts and Mandals:** The dataset covers multiple districts and mandals, allowing for comparative analysis of weather patterns across different geographical locations.
*   **Rainfall:** The 'Rain (mm)' column provides quantitative data on daily rainfall, which can be used to identify rainy seasons and assess rainfall distribution.
*   **Temperature:** The 'Min Temp (°C)' and 'Max Temp (°C)' columns provide insights into the daily temperature range. Analyzing these columns can reveal temperature trends and seasonal variations.
*   **Humidity:** The 'Min Humidity (%)' and 'Max Humidity (%)' columns indicate the range of humidity levels. These values can be analyzed to understand the moisture content in the air and its potential impact on other weather parameters.
*   **Wind Speed:** The 'Min Wind Speed (Kmph)' and 'Max Wind Speed (Kmph)' columns provide information on wind conditions. Analyzing these columns can reveal wind patterns and potential correlations with other weather variables.
*   **Imputation Impact:** A significant number of missing values were imputed. This could potentially skew the distribution of the affected columns. Any analysis involving these columns should be interpreted with caution.

**4. Recommendations**

*   **Date Conversion:** Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format to enable time-series analysis and extraction of temporal features (e.g., month, year, day of the week).
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct thorough EDA to understand the distributions of individual variables and relationships between them.
*   **Time-Series Analysis:** Perform time-series analysis to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies in weather patterns.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Compare weather patterns across different districts and mandals to identify regional variations.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Investigate correlations between different weather variables (e.g., rainfall and humidity, temperature and wind speed).
*   **Impact of Imputation:** Further investigate the impact of the imputation strategy on the data distribution and consider alternative imputation methods if necessary.
*   **External Data Integration:** Consider integrating external data sources (e.g., elevation data, land use data) to enrich the analysis and gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing weather patterns.

**5. Suggested Visualizations**

*   **Time-Series Plots:** Line plots of rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed over time to visualize trends and seasonality.
*   **Histograms and Box Plots:** Histograms and box plots to visualize the distributions of numerical variables and identify outliers.
*   **Scatter Plots:** Scatter plots to explore correlations between different weather variables.
*   **Bar Charts:** Bar charts to compare average weather conditions across different districts and mandals.
*   **Heatmaps:** Heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrix between different weather variables.
*   **Geographical Maps:** Choropleth maps to visualize the spatial distribution of weather variables across districts and mandals.
